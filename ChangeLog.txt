v0.2.0:

    * only generate the index file for the host platform by default; indexes
      for other platforms can be generated by passing the "platform" argument
      to write_index().
    * automatically install the modified zipimporter when zipimportx is
      executed as __main__.

v0.1.0:

    * initial release; you might say *everything* has changed.
