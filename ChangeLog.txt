v0.2.1:

    * Avoid touching the filesystem if given a path inside an already-loaded
      zipfile (which happens whenever importing from a package).
          * the default zipimporter trims the prefix by walking backwards down
            the path, calling stat() until it finds a real file.  We do the
            same but hit _zip_directory_cache instead of the filesystem.
          * unfortunately this has meant re-implementing basically all methods
            of zipimporter, since there's no way to set the "prefix" attr on
            the c-level zipimporter object without calling its constructor and
            hence hitting the filesystem.
          * fortunately, since the import process is mostly IO-bound this has
            not adversely affected the performance of this module.

v0.2.0:

    * only generate the index file for the host platform by default; indexes
      for other platforms can be generated by passing the "platform" argument
      to write_index().
    * automatically install the modified zipimporter when zipimportx is
      executed as __main__.

v0.1.0:

    * initial release; you might say *everything* has changed.
